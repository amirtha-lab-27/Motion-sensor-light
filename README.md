# Motion-sensor-light

Project Descrpition:

The "Motion Sensor Light" project is designed to create an automated lighting system that responds to human movement using an Arduino UNO microcontroller and a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor. The primary objective of this project is to enhance energy efficiency by turning on a light source only when motion is detected, eliminating the need for manual light control.

Components Used:

* Arduino UNO: The Arduino UNO serves as the central microcontroller unit that processes data from the PIR sensor and controls the lighting system.
* PIR Sensor: The PIR sensor is a key component that detects changes in infrared radiation caused by the movement of warm objects, such as humans or animals.
* Light Source: A light source, typically an LED or a light bulb, is connected to the Arduino and controlled based on the sensor's input.
* Wiring and Power Supply: Appropriate wiring and a power supply are used to connect and power the components.
